<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photobioreactors (PBRs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open systems</li><li>Closed systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photobioreactors (PBRs) are specialized systems designed to cultivate photosynthetic organisms, such as algae, under controlled conditions. The market for PBRs is divided into two primary types: open systems and closed systems. Open systems utilize natural sunlight and external water sources, often being cost-effective but less controlled environment-wise, which can affect yield and contamination risk. Closed systems, on the other hand, provide a controlled environment that enhances biomass production and purity, albeit at higher costs, making them suitable for high-value products.</p></p>
