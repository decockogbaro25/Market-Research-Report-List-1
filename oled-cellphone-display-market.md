<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Cellphone Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PMOLED</li><li>AMOLED</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED cellphone display market primarily features two types: PMOLED (Passive Matrix OLED) and AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED). PMOLED displays are simpler and suitable for smaller screens, using a passive grid to control pixels, making them cost-effective but less efficient for larger displays. On the other hand, AMOLED displays utilize an active matrix of transistors for individual pixel control, enabling higher resolution, faster refresh rates, and superior color quality, making them ideal for modern high-end smartphones.</p></p>
