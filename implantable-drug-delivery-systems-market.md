<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Drug Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable</li><li>Non-Biodegradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable drug delivery systems can be categorized into biodegradable and non-biodegradable types. Biodegradable systems gradually dissolve within the body, releasing medication over time and eliminating the need for surgical removal. They enhance patient compliance and reduce the risk of infection. In contrast, non-biodegradable systems remain intact after delivering the drug, requiring surgical extraction. This type often allows for extended drug release and precise control over dosing but may come with increased complexity in management. Both types play crucial roles in therapeutic advancements.</p></p>
